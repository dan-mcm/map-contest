# Frequently Asked Questions

## I have previously made and published a map to Steam, can I enter this to the competition?
Yes however you must ensure the following:

* The map is entirely of your own creation
* The map is not a port of a legacy CnCnet map
* The map is still accessible via usermaps in game

## I have a few maps I would like to submit, how many can I enter?
There is a maximum limit of 2 maps per person allowed for submission

## I have uploaded my maps to Steam Workshop successfully but they aren't showing ingame, what gives?
The ingame system can be temperamental, if after a 48hr period your maps are not visible in game you may need to send them manually to Danku.
Reach out to him to make arrangements via Discord.
