## Judges

## Deadline
Maps must be uploaded to the steam workshop and accessible in-game by <b>Friday 9th July 2021</b>.  
Submissions will be listed under the Submissions section once received.

There will be up to 2 weeks deliberation time for judges to announce results.

## Map Requirements

Your map should be designed with the following in mind:

* It will be used as a competitive 1 v 1 map - only 2 spawn points should feature on the map
* Any tileset is fine so long as it is compatible with the base C&C Remastered Tiberian Dawn game
* The design must be of your own making, ports from legacy CnCnet maps are not accepted

You should design your map with the below marking criteria in mind.

## Marking Criteria

Judges will each complete a score sheet for maps submitted, these will be averaged to determine the final map scores.

### Tiberium
* Do both spawn points have equal access to starting tiberium fields/amounts?
* Does one spawn have a mining advantage over another?
* Is there a reasonable amount of tiberium available? Not too much/too little.

### Use of Terrain / Objects
* Creativity and use of physical elements such as walls, village structures, trees, rivers, cliffs and other terrain elements
* Use of non-physical aesthetic elements such as Smudges / Road Markings
* Elements of Realism in map layout i.e. explosion smudges in a pre-damaged town, mirrored maps with different terrain/obstacles i.e. one corner cut off with broken bridge, another with cliffs and trees

### Map Goals / Points of Interest
* Is there a clear focal point for players to aim towards for map control?

This may be a contested tiberium field that may give the owning player an eco advantage, it may be better positioning on some high ground/center of map that gives a player a distinct strategic advantage, it may be capturable neutral buildings players can build off.

### Base Building / Skill Expression
Crawls are an iconic part of the competitive Tiberian Dawn ladder, does your map allow opportunities for players to:

* Crawl in multiple directions
* Take advantage of faction strengths/weaknesses,
* Have a fast/short game, mid game, long/longer game?
