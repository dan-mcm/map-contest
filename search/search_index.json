Submissions will be listed under the Submissions section once received. Map Requirements Your map should be designed with the following in mind: It will be used as a competitive 1 v 1 map - only 2 spawn points should feature on the map Any tileset is fine so long as it is compatible with the base C&C Remastered Tiberian Dawn game The design must be of your own making, ports from legacy CnCnet maps are not accepted You should design your map with the below marking criteria in mind. Marking Criteria Judges will each complete a score sheet for maps submitted, these will be averaged to determine the final map scores. Tiberium Do both spawn points have equal access to starting tiberium fields/amounts? Does one spawn have a mining advantage over another? Is there a reasonable amount of tiberium available? Not too much/too little. Use of Terrain / Objects Creativity and use of physical elements such as walls, village structures, trees, rivers, cliffs and other terrain elements Use of non-physical aesthetic elements such as Smudges / Road Markings Elements of Realism in map layout i.e. explosion smudges in a pre-damaged town, mirrored maps with different terrain/obstacles i.e. one corner cut off with broken bridge, another with cliffs and trees Map Goals / Points of Interest Is there a clear focal point for players to aim towards for map control? This may be a contested tiberium field that may give the owning player an eco advantage, it may be better positioning on some high ground/center of map that gives a player a distinct strategic advantage, it may be capturable neutral buildings players can build off. Base Building / Skill Expression Crawls are an iconic part of the competitive Tiberian Dawn ladder, does your map allow opportunities for players to: Crawl in multiple directions Take advantage of faction strengths/weaknesses, Have a fast/short game, mid game, long/longer game?
