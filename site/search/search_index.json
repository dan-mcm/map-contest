Marking Criteria Judges will each complete a score sheet for maps submitted, these will be averaged to determine the final map scores. Tiberium Do both spawn points have equal access to starting tiberium fields/amounts? Does one spawn have a mining advantage over another? Is there a reasonable amount of tiberium available? Not too much/too little. Use of Terrain / Objects Creativity and use of physical elements such as walls, village structures, trees, rivers, cliffs and other terrain elements Use of non-physical aesthetic elements such as Smudges / Road Markings Elements of Realism in map layout i.e. explosion smudges in a pre-damaged town, mirrored maps with different terrain/obstacles i.e. one corner cut off with broken bridge, another with cliffs and trees Map Goals / Points of Interest Is there a clear focal point for players to aim towards for map control? This may be a contested tiberium field that may give the owning player an eco advantage, it may be better positioning on some high ground/center of map that gives a player a distinct strategic advantage, it may be capturable neutral buildings players can build off.
